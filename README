# Beaver Text editor (still my favourite)

**This repository has not been updated for several years**  So I have uploaded some .deb versions of it. which can be downloaded and installed in
any debian based distro. Including Ubuntu, and there is also a raspberry pi version too!

The reason I felt the need to do this, *despite the fact that debian does have this in their repository* is because I have noticed the version offered
in the Debian repos doesn't work all that well, and the plugins (which I really like) don't exist. They do in these .deb files however. 

The Plugin I most like is the **Ascii art plugin**. 

I do hope someday developers will come back to this wonderful project and write some markdown plugins and a few updated ones, so that
this wonderfully light text editor may again be more widely know and therefore used.


I have included: 

* Beaver text editor .Deb for 64 bit pc's

* Beaver text editor .deb for i386 pc's

' beaver text editor .armhf.deb which can be used in the **rasperry  pi**

Beaver 0.2.7
Marc Bevand, Damien Terrier and Emmanuel Turquin, 2000-2003


INTRODUCTION
------------
  First of all, many thanks for your interest in Beaver. Beaver is an Early
AdVanced EditoR, for Linux and other Unices (and even Windows); in other words,
it's a text editor that is lightweight but full of features for programming,
from web authoring to C programming. It is based on the GTK+ toolkit, supports
tons of languages through config files (100% compatible with UltraEdit
'wordfile.txt' -- see ultraedit.com for more informations) and offers
functions such as automatic indentation, correction and completion, or syntax
highlighting. It also has its own mini macro language.
Beaver is released under the GNU General Public License and has been started
as an end-of-year project for our second year at the french computing school
EPITA. Of course, any remark or advice (or even contribution) are the welcome!

   older releases should work fine too).
